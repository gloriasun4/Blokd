Blokd aims to help students suffering from online school fatigue by minimizing online distractions and motivating them to stay on track and complete their work. Students will be able to use our extension to monitor their time spent on websites such as YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, and so many more. By keeping track of allotted screen time and alerting users when their time for these websites is up, Blokd offers a simple yet effective solution for combatting distraction.

# How to add the chrome extension?
1. Clone the github repository
2. Add it to your chrome extensions
3. Select websites you want to limit times. Default time limit is 1 hour total on all the websites you choose.
4. Do your work normally and if you go over your time limit, there will be a funny pop-up
